		<p>Hello, world! My name is Robin. I currently work as a private equity investor in Singapore, primarily focusing on Asian <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_equity_secondary_market">secondaries</a>. Before that, I worked in infrastructure private equity in New York. And even before that, I was an economics student at the University of Cambridge.</p>
		<p>I spend most of my free time climbing, cooking, practicing my Chinese, and lurking on the blogs of more accomplished people. I hope to use this site to keep track of my thoughts and side projects.</p>
		<p>If there's anything you'd like to discuss, I can be reached via <a href="mailto:robinzxu@gmail.com">email</a>. I love meeting new people and would be happy converse on just about anything.</p>
		<p>I've been in Singapore since 2018, but was born and raised in Gainesville, Florida (Go Gators!). My family is from Nanjing, China.</p>
