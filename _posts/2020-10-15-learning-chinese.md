As noted on the front page of this site, learning Chinese has been a major goal of mine for roughly the last three years. I finally felt confident enough to take the HSK 6 exam in September, and a week ago received the happy news that I'd passed. Getting to this stage has been an on and off process, with me losing motivation for long periods of time and pursuing learning methods which proved slow or ineffective. However, I was eventually able to settle on a learning process which worked and helped propel me through most of my studies over the last year and a half. Since I've recently had quite a few friends ask me about my experience, I thought I'd share some of my learnings here.
