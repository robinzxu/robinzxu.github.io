A week following my [first post](https://robinzxu.github.io/blog/2020/03/24/thoughts-on-coronavirus){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} regarding COVID-19, here are four more thoughts on the situation.

1. **Zhao Lijian might end up being the most influential person you've never heard of**  
Zhao Lijian is a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry Information Department. He is also an unbridled Twitter fiend whose recent conspiratorial [claims](https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1238111898828066823){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} that the US military planted COVID-19 in China have done more to poison the well of US-China relations than any other single act I can think of in recent memory. Zhao Lijian may argue that his tweets were simply a response to the asinine claims by Senator Tom Cotton that COVID-19 was a Chinese bioweapon, or Representative Jim Banks' calls for reparations. But I still can't figure out what he was trying to accomplish. He wasn't seeking to play to his home audience. After all, he made his post in English on Twitter. Was he trying to win over Westerners tired of the Trump administration to his side? He shouldn't have tried given how united all parts of the US political spectrum have become on issues regarding China. And he wasn't simply parroting his higher ups either. Cui Tiankai, China's ambassador to the US, has publicly [come out](https://www.axios.com/china-coronavirus-ambassador-cui-tiankai-1b0404e8-026d-4b7d-8290-98076f95df14.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}  against his conspiracies. Whatever his motive, he has given away any goodwill China earned through its successful containment of COVID-19, provisions of supplies to other countries, and moves to position itself as the adult in the room vis-Ã -vis the US. This incident will only serve to harden the stance of China hawks who are increasingly growing in number and influence. I expect the trade and media wars to intensify substantially following this pandemic.

2. **Adam Neumann and Masayoshi Son will be remembered as emblematic of the fall of Silicon Valley over the last decade**  
I know, I know. WeWork is headquartered in New York and neither Adam Neumann nor Masayoshi Son are based in California. Silicon Valley has also been soaring in recent years, with Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft all becoming trillion dollar companies.  

3. **This recovery will take a while**  
A lack of coordination domestically (US) and internationally makes it hard to see an end for this crisis. U shaped recovery rather than a V. Maybe even W shaped if we get another wave

4. **Reusable masks are desperately needed**  
It's become quite clear that it would be nearly impossible for any hospital, city, or country to stockpile enough surgical masks and respirators for a real pandemic. Surgical masks are meant to be changed between patients, and respirators become difficult to breathe through after 3-4 hours as their filters become clogged. This means that for a city of Singapore's size (5.8 million people), 10-20 million masks might be needed every day if proper usage were to be maintained. So why hasn't there been a bigger push towards producing reusable alternatives so that people don't have to jerry-rig their own out of rubber bands and t-shirts? Washable cloth masks with a hydrophobic layer, similar to what can be found in disposable three-layer surgical masks, should be provided to the general public so that disease transmission rates and hoarding behaviour are reduced. Respirators should be constructed with robust, reusable bodies so that authorities could stockpile just their filters instead. It's not clear to me why the bodies of many respirators have to be made with paperboard or other disposable materials since these sections are not meant to be permeable anyway. The filters on these respirators take up only a small proportion of their total volume, so just storing filters would be substantially more feasible than storing whole masks. All of these steps could be taken with existing technology and would reduce the burden of stockpiling by an order of magnitude, if not more.
