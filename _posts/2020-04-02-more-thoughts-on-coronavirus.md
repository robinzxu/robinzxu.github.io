A week following my [first post](https://robinzxu.github.io/blog/2020/03/24/thoughts-on-coronavirus){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} regarding COVID-19, here are four more thoughts on the situation.

1. **Zhao Lijian might end up being the most influential person you've never heard of**  
Zhao Lijian is a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry Information Department. He is also an unbridled Twitter fiend whose recent conspiratorial [claims](https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1238111898828066823){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} that the US military planted COVID-19 in China have done more to poison the well of US-China relations than any other single act I can think of in recent memory. Zhao Lijian may argue that his tweets were simply a response to the asinine claims by Senator Tom Cotton that COVID-19 was a Chinese bioweapon, or Representative Jim Banks' calls for reparations. But I still can't figure out what he was trying to accomplish. He wasn't seeking to play to his home audience. After all, he made his post in English on Twitter. And he wasn't simply parroting his higher ups either. Cui Tiankai, China's ambassador to the US, has publicly [come out](https://www.axios.com/china-coronavirus-ambassador-cui-tiankai-1b0404e8-026d-4b7d-8290-98076f95df14.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}  against his conspiracies. Whatever his motive, he has given away any goodwill China earned through its successful containment of COVID-19 and provisions of supplies to other countries. This incident will only serve to harden the stance of China hawks who are increasingly growing in number and influence. I expect the trade and media wars to intensify substantially following this pandemic.

2. **Adam Neumann and Masayoshi Son will be remembered as the faces of price inflation over the last decade**



3. **This recovery will take a while**  
A lack of coordination domestically (US) and internationally makes it hard to see an end for this crisis. U shaped recovery rather than a V. Maybe even W shaped if we get another wave

4. **Reusable masks are desperately needed**
