Here's one final post on the coronavirus (at least for now)! The first two are [here](https://robinzxu.github.io/blog/2020/03/24/thoughts-on-coronavirus){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [here](https://robinzxu.github.io/blog/2020/04/02/more-thoughts-on-coronavirus){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

1. **The right time to react is when no one yet thinks it's the right time to react**  
As the saying goes, "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure". Just as this applies to brushing teeth and exercising, so it does with political and health crises like the ones we're going through now. Unfortunately, actually living by this motto often implies eating upfront costs without clearly visible benefits. For brushing teeth, the cost would be the hassle of having to spend time doing it every day, just to keep your teeth at their current state. For COVID, the cost is putting the entire economy in stasis in order to protect some people who might otherwise die in a more widespread pandemic. It's been surreal here in Singapore watching the government (and those of other countries) drip-feed increasingly stringent regulations as the COVID situation worsens, slowly moving towards a full lockdown but unwilling to do it proactively without first having a large enough pile of bodies to point at as evidence of its necessity. I don't understand why they can't move faster. Are they worried that they population might overreact and blame them for being overly conservative? Surely not in this case. While I can understand that concern in many policy debates where the counterfactual scenario is unclear, COVID's impact in Wuhan, Italy, and Spain should surely be evidence enough of the dangers of inaction.

2. **More offices will finally begin to discourage working while sick**  
I don't know how it is in workplaces outside of my own, but I have long worked with the unspoken understanding that you come to work regardless of whether or not you are sick. To actually take sick leave would be to let your team down or show weakness. Judging from this October 2019 [survey](http://rh-us.mediaroom.com/2019-10-24-9-In-10-Employees-Come-To-Work-Sick-Survey-Shows){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} of US workers which found that 90% have gone to work while sick, my situation is probably pretty similar to that of most people. Suffice to say, the reactions of your bosses and coworkers to such behaviour going forward will probably be quite different from how they would've responded pre-COVID. Beyond being better for everyone's quality of life, increased usage of sick leave while actually sick will probably also *save* many lives. Japan has already begun to see [flu cases](https://www.wsj.com/articles/japan-sees-silver-lining-to-coronavirus-as-flu-cases-drop-11583073526){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} decline as people adjust how they behave while sick. Moreover, it is estimated that globally approximately [389,000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6815659/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} people die from the flu each year; if the current pandemic is effective at teaching us better hygiene habits, the positive benefits going forward could be substantial.

3. **Savings rates are going to increase a lot**

4. **In the long-run, the way that people work and live might not change that much**
The way people live won't change as much as people are saying
