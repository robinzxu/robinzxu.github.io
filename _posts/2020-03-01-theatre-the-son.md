Last weekend, Keisha took me to see the opening night performance of Florian Zeller\'s "The Son", being performed by local theatre company Pangdemonium. 

If you\'re someone who\'s *very* into the arts and wants to see a new show every week then perhaps cities like New York or London would be better fits.
