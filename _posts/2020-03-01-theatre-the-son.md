Last weekend, Keisha took me to see the opening night performance of Florian Zeller\'s *The Son*, performed by local theatre company Pangdemonium. Despite the threat of COVID-19 in the background and increased security measures at the theatre (everyone who entered was being ID'd), the crowd was generally in good spirits and the show opened to a full house.

If you\'re someone who\'s *very* into the arts and wants to see a new show every week then perhaps cities like New York or London would be better fits.
