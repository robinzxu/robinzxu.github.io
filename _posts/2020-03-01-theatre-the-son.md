Last weekend, Keisha took me to see the opening night performance of Florian Zeller\'s *The Son*, performed by local theatre company Pangdemonium. Despite the threat of COVID-19 in the background and increased security measures at the theatre (everyone who entered was ID'd and had their name recorded), the crowd was generally in good spirits and the show opened to a full house.

*The Son* begins by introducing us to the teenage Nicolas, alone in a dark room scrawling an illegible script on the wall.

Despite being much-maligned by many of my local friends, I\'ve generally founded the local arts scene to be quite impressive given Singapore's size and location. There isn\'t much in the way of protest art, but other genres are generally well funded and developing. If you\'re someone who expects to see new shows and exhibits every week, then perhaps cities like New York or London would be better fits. But for someone like me who might attend three or four plays a year, Singapore has more than enough to offer.
