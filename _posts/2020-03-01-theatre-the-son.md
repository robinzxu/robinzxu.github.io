Last weekend, Keisha took me to see the opening night performance of Florian Zeller\'s *The Son*, performed at the Drama Centre by local theatre company Pangdemonium. Despite the threat of COVID-19 looming in the background and increased security measures at the theatre (everyone who entered was ID\'d and had their name recorded), the crowd was generally in good spirits and the show opened to a full house.

*The Son* begins by introducing us to the teenage Nicolas, alone in a dark room scrawling an illegible script on the wall. As the scene shifts, we discover that Nicolas is severely depressed and had been skipping school for the past few months, likely due to his father, Pierre, leaving his mother, Anne, to start a relationship with the younger, more attractive Sofia. As Nicolas\' depression spirals deeper, his parents (and the ever-reluctant Sofia) attempt to lift him out of his gloom by allowing him to change schools and live with his father. However, this proves to be no match for the potent cocktail that is egocentric parenting, teenage angst, and puberty.

I found the plot of the play to be straightforward and a bit predictable, though the quality of the actors and the production value of the set more than made up for this. There was a sweet moment at the end of the show when it was revealed that Pierre and Nicolas had been played by the father-son duo of Adrian Pang and Zachary Pang, while Tracie Pang (Adrian\'s wife/Zachary\'s mother) directed.

This was the fourth play I\'ve seen in Singapore, after *The Truth*, *Mergers and Accusations*, and *Merdeka*. Despite the local arts scene being much-maligned by many of my local friends, I\'ve generally found it to be quite impressive given Singapore\'s size and location. There isn\'t much in the way of protest art, but other genres are generally well-funded and developing. If you\'re someone who expects to see new shows and exhibits every week, then perhaps cities like New York or London would be better fits. But for someone like me who might attend three or four plays a year, Singapore has more than enough to offer.
