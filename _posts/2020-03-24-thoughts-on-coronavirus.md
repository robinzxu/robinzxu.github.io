It\'s been nearly four months now since COVID-19 first appeared in Wuhan. At the time of writing, roughly 435,000 cases have been officially recorded, along with 20,000 deaths. Global travel has ground to a halt as countries close their borders, cruise ships have been denied port access, and Hongkongers (among others) have turned to [armed robbery](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3050907/armed-gang-steals-hk1000-toilet-paper-coronavirus){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in the search for toilet paper. But even after all this, the magnitude of the situation seems to have escaped a good number of people. [Spring breakers](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2020/03/19/spring-break-beaches-florida-look-packed-despite-coronavirus-spread/2873248001/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} are still partying hard, Californians are [crowding the trailheads](https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-californians-sheltering-in-place-doesnt-include-hiking-in-crowds-11585065557){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and Donald Trump has seemingly [given up](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1241935285916782593/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (not that he was trying in the first place). Here are 10 quick thoughts on the COVID-19 situation up to this point.

1. **We should've seen this coming**  
Coronavirus spread in 

2. **The yen may no longer be the safe haven it once was**

3. **US fracking companies will have a hard time starting up again**  
Might still be economic in the long-run, but people will be unwilling to lend givne the risk of Saudi repeating this

4. **This could be the US' "Suez Moment"**  
Eastern countries have almost universally managed the crisis better

5. **The right time to react is when no one yet thinks it's the right time to react**  
Leaders don't want to react until they have to. However, the right time to act is probably when the probably seems small. If you are successful, people will think you have overreacted

6. **Zhao Lijian might end up being the most influential person you've never heard of**

7. **US governmental capacity is shockingly low**

8. **This recovery will take a while**  
A lack of coordination domestically (US) and internationally makes it hard to see an end for this crisis. U shaped recovery rather than a V. Maybe even W shaped if we get another wave

9. **Reusable masks are desperately needed**

10. **The trade war is probably going to get a lot worse**
