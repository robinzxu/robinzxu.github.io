Many things pass through my head on a daily basis, but most of it ends up disappearing into the ether. I'm hoping to capture at least some of them in writing on this blog.

The posts here will be much more for my own benefit rather than anyone else's (not that anyone else would want to read this stuff anyway) and so may be unkempt and disorganised at times.

I'll do my best to fix inaccuracies and keep things up-to-date, but <a href="mailto:robinzxu@gmail.com">do let me know</a> if there's anything I've missed.

All the best

Robin
