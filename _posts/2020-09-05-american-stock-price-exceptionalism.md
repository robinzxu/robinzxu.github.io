The FT came out with an incredible [article](https://www.ft.com/content/75587aa6-1f1f-4e9d-b334-3ff866753fa2){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on Friday detailing the billions of dollars in tech stock calls that SoftBank apparently bought over the last month. Not content with only ruining private market valuations, Masayoshi Son (and his merry band of Robinhooders) has apparently trained his money cannon on public equities now too. 

While details regarding what exactly SoftBank holds are still scarce, this news does provide an elegant solution to the question of what is going on with US tech stocks. Before Friday's pull-back, the Nasdaq had been up 33% year-to-date and 76% from March lows, shrugging off the impact of COVID as if it were nothing (or in this case, somehow a positive). All this with double-digit unemployment and no end to COVID in sight.

Most people&mdash;including myself&mdash;remain confused as to what could be causing such bullishness, but the most common explanation I've heard is that investors are pivoting away from bonds and other yielding assets due to their now zero or near-zero rates. A glance at the discounted cash flow formula tells us that, keeping cash flows and risk premiums constant (as could arguably be the case for certain tech companies), valuations mechanically increase as we lower the risk-free rate. (In fact, assuming a long enough duration and stable enough cash flows, valuations tend towards infinity with negative rates!)

However, I've always found this explanation to be a bit lacking as it doesn't explain why Europe and Japan haven't experienced the same ripping returns on display in the US. After all, these countries have maintained negative rates and practiced non-stop quantitative easing for over half a decade now. SoftBank could be a big piece of the gravity-defying puzzle that is the US tech market.

In some weird way, this story meshes better with what I'd expect of SoftBank than what they've actually been doing in recent years with the Vision Fund. After all, the core members of the Vision Fund team (Rajeev Misra, Colin Fan, Munish Varma, etc.) were all former traders at Deutsche Bank. Anyone who's worked in finance can tell you that trading generally has little to do with actual operations or business fundamentals, which might explain why so many of the Vision Fund's investments have done so poorly. However, it does train you to look out for and exploit market eccentricities like delta-hedging feedback loops. This whole episode could just be SoftBank going back to what they know best. Time will tell if this new strategy is more successful than their prior ones.
