It\'s been nearly three months now since COVID-19 first appeared in Wuhan and the global response has been aggressive. At the time of writing, some 77 million people in China have been placed under lockdown, a number which taken alone would respresent the world\'s 20th largest population (between Germany and Thailand). Numerous countries and airlines have suspended travel from China, cruise ships have been denied port access, and Hong Kongers have turned to [armed robbery](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3050907/armed-gang-steals-hk1000-toilet-paper-coronavirus){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in the search for toilet paper.

Strict government action may seem sensible in light of the fact that COVID-19 has already claimed over 2,200 lives and infected some 78,000 people. But given the highly contagious nature of the disease and its relatively low mortality rate, many of these measures may ultimately prove to be futile and do more harm than good. While it\'s still far too early to tell the ultimate economic impact of the virus, [early estimates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/19/coronavirus-could-cost-global-economy-1tn-in-lost-output){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} suggest that factory shutdowns, lower consumption, and decreased travel may lead to a decline in global growth of up to 1.3% in 2020. That\'s equivalent to $1.1tn in lost income.

It\'s impossible to know how many more ([or less!](https://medium.com/@indica/how-japan-made-covid-19-worse-c97180df9c95){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}) infections and deaths the disease may have caused were the response not as forceful, or what the economic impact would have been in that scenario. However, it\'s almost certainly the case that [bumbling government action](https://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-01-28-20-intl-hnk/h_de6f7529da8c257da95ca55439097408){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} has stoked public fear and hysteria, contributing to the economic disruption. Supply chains and work arrangements have been severely disrupted, placing businesses at risk of failing and workers at risk of losing their jobs. Such costs should not simply be waved away.

I won\'t speculate here as to how we should measure the pecuniary value of a human life; different countries and organisations already have [many](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/psb.1562){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} [ways](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-value-of-life/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} of doing it. But if we divide $1.1tn by the EPA\'s estimate of roughly $10mm (which is specific to the US and on the higher end anyway), that would be equal to 110,000 lives. Let\'s say that only 20% of the economic impact could have been avoided through less strident controls. That would still imply an economic cost roughly equal to 22,000 lives. A relaxation of controls would have to kill ten times the number of people who have already died before the human cost outweighs the economic gain.

A more measured response befitting a disease which only kills 

Just as
