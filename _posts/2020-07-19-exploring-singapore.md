As with most people, Keisha and I have been stuck in Singapore for the last six months or so as a result of COVID shutting down global travel. Since we can't visit anywhere else, we decided that now would be a good time to explore some of the parts of Singapore that we haven't yet been to. I've always found it interesting how we tend to not explore the places where we live; I spent three years in the UK for university but barely left my bubble in Cambridge's city centre. And earlier this year when I was planning our trip to Gainesville in December (now cancelled), I realised that I barely knew the place despite spending 18 years there. (Did you know that Gainesville apparently has bison?? I didn't know that...) So here's our attempt at making sure the same thing doesn't repeat itself in Singapore!
